## String Matching Samples

Any operation that processes data almost certainly needs to handle strings. This sample provides two Rule Applications that demonstrate InRule's string manipulation capabilities.

* The rule application `1.StringMatchingExamples.ruleapp` provides basic examples of using the most common string functions.
* The rule application `2.OrderStringsExample.ruleapp` provides more advanced examples by implementing example order processing requirements that rely on the use of various string functions and templates.

The included file *String Matching Examples Rule Application Notes.pdf* describes the samples in more detail.
