# InRule Samples

## Iteration Patterns

Rule Applications frequently have a need to apply rules repeatedly over a collection or list of items. This iteration pattern may be accomplished several ways in InRule.

The Rule Applications in the Iteration samples demonstrate four ways to iterate within InRule:

1. Automatic Rule Sets within a child Entity context
2. Parent activation of Automatic Rule Sets within a child Entity context
3. Execute Member Rule Set
4. While loops

The included file *Iteration Examples Rule Application Notes.pdf* describes these examples in more detail.
