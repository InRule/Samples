Decision Services
====

Decision Services is the newest member of InRuleÂ®'s Decision Platform. It provides an improved, simpler model for authoring and executing rules, as well as an integration model that is standards-based that does not require deep knowledge of our SDK.

A decision in Decision Services is an entry point into rule exection. It consists of a set of inputs, rules that execute against those inputs, and a set of ouputs that reflect that result. Those inputs, outputs, and rules are author-defined, ultimately providing rule authors flexibility of shaping the input and output signature using during runtime execution.

Once authored is complete, Decisions can be tested in irVerify and subsequently published to a Decision Runtime for remote execution via a RESTful API. That Decision Runtime provides an OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) document which is a programming language-agnostic description on how to execute the published decisions, including each decision's required input and output result.

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you'll need to make sure you have the following:

* For authoring and testing Decisions, [irAuthor 5.5.0](https://support.inrule.com/downloads.aspx) or greater.

* For publishing and executing Decisions, access to a [Decision Runtime Service](#decision-runtime-service) using [Centralized Authentication](#centralized-authentication). Please contact [InRule Support](mailto:support@inrule.com) in order to request access.

### Decision Runtime Service

The Decision Runtime Service is responsible for storing and executing published Decisions. It also provides several OpenAPI documents based on the [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/) (both [2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) and [3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md)) as well as a [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) interface. This allows integration with 3rd part tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or generating client code based on your published decisions.

### Centralized Authentication

Instead of relying on an irCatalog instance for authentication, InRule's hosted Decision Runtime Service integrates with its Centralized Authentication solution (running on the [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) platform). This authentication solution provides customers the ability to authenticate using external authentication providers including Azure Active Directory or any OpenID Connect compatible provider.
