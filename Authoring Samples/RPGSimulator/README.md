This sample was created in conjunction with a blog post on https://www.inrule.com/resource/blog/ as a rule modeling exercise. This is not intended to be a complete and exhaustive rule application for all your table-top roleplaying needs but just a fun exercise in taking a complex process of combat in a table top role-playing game and modeling them in rules. This sample contains a Rule Application that encodes this process. The included file RPG Simulator.pdf contains a detailed explanation of the sample Rule Application, along with a link to the original InRule blog post on the subject</article>
