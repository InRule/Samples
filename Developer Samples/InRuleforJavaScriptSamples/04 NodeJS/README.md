# InRule for JavaScript Samples

## Mortgage Calculator - Advanced Sample

This sample demonstrates one rule application calling another. The mortgage calculator has been modified to look up the APR based on the term. The lookup is performed using an Execute JavaScript Function action. The function uses JQuery to call to a service that is hosted in NodeJS. The service returns the APR by leveraging another JavaScript rule app.
