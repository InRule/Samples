# InRule for JavaScript Samples

## Mortgage Calculator - Angular Sample

This sample builds off of the Basic sample. However, all of the data uses Angular data binding and is automatically mapped to the object for us. The results do not need to be mapped either as Angular operates on the same underlying object as the rule engine and will automatically update the page after the engine updates the values.
